# Casual Run Arcade - Godot v3.x.x game project

This repository represents the code for a game project that I have been working on and managed to publish it on Play Store (in the mean time I did not updated the app and got delisted).

The project is pretty basic, it has a main menu screen, character selection, points system, lives system, integrated Yodo1 SDK and the main game. All the assets are royalty free assets done by Kenney (https://kenney.nl/).
